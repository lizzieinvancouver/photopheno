## OSPREE ...

analyses/studytype.R lets you find multiphotoperiod treatments (subset(xx, photo>4)) of which:
- heide93a is interesting, suggests strong effect in Fagus (would be good to check the other multi-photoperiod studies for Fagus to see if possible to explain it away) and nothing in Carpinus
- should find viheraaarnio06
- howe95 is actually budset

I also went through OSPREE.xlsx for `interr' and there are two studies with light interruptions, but they are for Fragaria!
